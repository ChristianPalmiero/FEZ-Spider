## Intro
Spider Lock is a facial recognition system that provides a fast and easy way to identify or verify a person from a digital image.
First, the end user inserts his credentials (username and password); then, he takes a picture of his face. If he is recognised and obtains the authorisation, a signal that points out the success of the operations is shown; otherwise, he has three attempts to insert a one-time password (nonce code). If he fails, a signal that states that the end user has not been authorised is displayed.

## Components
The system consists of:
* a touch screen that allows the final user to insert his credentials and the one-time
password sent by the system via SMS;
* a camera that takes the picture of the user face;
* a LED that indicates, using an intuitive color system, whether the user has
been authorised or not (e.g. green: success; red: failure).
