# Spider Lock
Spider Lock is a facial recognition system that provides a fast and easy way to identify or verify a person from a digital image.
First, the end user inserts his credentials (username and password); then, he takes a picture of his face. If he is recognised and obtains the authorisation, a signal that points out the success of the operations is shown; otherwise, he has three attempts to insert a one-time password (nonce code). If he fails, a signal that states that the end user has not been authorised is displayed.
